# 🚕 Uber Fare Prediction – NYC

A production-style Machine Learning project that predicts Uber fares in New York City using a CatBoost regression model deployed with Flask.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, training, deployment, and a user-friendly web interface.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This application predicts the estimated Uber fare based on:

* 📍 Pickup Location
* 🏁 Dropoff Location
* 🕒 Pickup Date & Time
* 👥 Passenger Count
* 🌤 Weather Condition
* 🚗 Car Condition
* 🚦 Traffic Condition

The trained model is exposed through a Flask web application where users can enter trip information and receive fare predictions in real time.

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

* Build and compare multiple regression models.
* Select the best-performing model using objective evaluation metrics.
* Deploy the trained model as a Flask web application.
* Ensure identical preprocessing during both training and inference.
* Validate user inputs to prevent invalid predictions.

# ⚙️ Machine Learning Pipeline

The project follows the complete machine learning workflow:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Selection
6. Model Serialization
7. Flask Deployment
8. Real-Time Prediction

The same preprocessing pipeline is used during both training and inference, eliminating Training/Serving Skew.

---

# 🔍 Feature Engineering

The application automatically computes:

* Trip Distance (Haversine Formula)
* Bearing
* Distance to JFK Airport
* Distance to LaGuardia Airport
* Distance to NYC City Center
* Cyclic Time Features

  * Hour
  * Weekday
  * Month
* Rush Hour
* Weekend Flag
* Night Flag
* Encoded Traffic Condition
* Encoded Car Condition

# 🤖 Model Comparison

The following regression models were evaluated:

| Model                   |      MAE |     RMSE |       R² |
| ----------------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Linear Regression       |      ... |      ... |      ... |
| Random Forest Regressor |      ... |      ... |      ... |
| **CatBoost Regressor**  | **1.57** | **3.27** | **0.88** |

CatBoost was selected because it achieved the best overall balance between prediction accuracy, robustness, and inference speed on the test dataset.
